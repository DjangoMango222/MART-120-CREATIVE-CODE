ClS and GUI are simply two different ways to write GitHub code. The main difference between the command line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI) in GitHub 
is that the CLI uses text-based commands, while the GUI uses visual elements. GitHub Desktop simplifies the interaction with GitHub repositories through visualization tasks 
and elements that affect the HTML. With GitHub Desktop, it's much easier to manage a large number of files, cutting down on the time it usually takes to input all of that stuff
into GitHub on the website. In contrast, the CLI allows users to access repositories using text-based commands, which is seen as a more flexible and direct chain for some, but 
the learning curve is much steeper. The desktop version is supposed to be the most user-friendly. Users won't need to memorize git commands, and this version provides the repository's
stats and a visual representation of the history.  I have taken a course on writing HTML with CSS.
